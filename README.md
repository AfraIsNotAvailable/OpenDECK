# OpenDECK

A personal (for now) **shortcuts/macropad** web app based on Flask and pure HTML/CSS/JS

## Features

- Buttons for each app defined shortcut
- Detects what app you're currently using (barely) // TODO: make it useful

## Installation

(user installation in progress -- for now it's more of a prototype/personal interface)

## Usage

It's a local web app, I use my tablet and a browser to use the shortcuts

## Gallery
